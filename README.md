The base URL is: `https://wdi-nyc-planets-api.herokuapp.com`
Available endpoints: `/planets` and `/planets/random`

## Getting Started
- Fork and clone this repo
- Create a react app named planets
- Install Axios and [React Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

## Requirements
- Your app should have routes for PlanetList, PlanetDetail, RandomPlanet and a Welcome Route.
- PlanetList should render all the planet names with a Link to the PlanetDetail component.
- PlanetDetail should render the data for an individual planet's color and num moons.
- RandomPlanet should route to an endpoint `/planets/random` and render a random planet.
- Welcome should be a welcome page for the user showing the Link to PlanetList and RandomPlanet.
- Style the App.

## Submission
- A pull request by 11pm tonight
- A comment with your wins and comfort and completion levels.
